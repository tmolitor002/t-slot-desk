# Desk Ideas

- keep wireless keyboard/mouse
	- usb-c cables nearby and ready to charge peripherals
- Shelf underneath main monitor - should be a bit lower (1" - 1 1/2") than the ikea one
	- Should be floating and attached to the frame - would be nice if height adjustable
	- Should be able to fit the two caldigit hubs, the l1 techs kvm, and the stacked schiit audio stuff underneath
	- peripheral cables that can come out and will retract back in (only for charging) underneath main shelf
		- maybe one or two networking cables too - just to see what's up
- Monitor mounted to larger frame that covers width of desk
- raised speakers - look into wall mounts
- TV on back side facing couch
- rgb lighting? diffusers?

# KVM/Monitor Assignments

- L1 Techs KVM will sit between the multiple computers and some (but not all) monitors. Audio and Keyboard/Mouse will also follow the host selection. The following monitors will be under the control of the KVM:
	- Ultrawide
	- Center top monitor
	- Both Xeneon Edge Touchscreens
- The Left and Right top monitors will be connected directly to one computer each. The left monitor is always connected to the Framework 16 Laptop, and the right monitor will always be connected to the primary work computer (Currently a MacBook). This will enable one screen from the inactive host to remain on and active.

## Use cases for inactive monitor
- During work hours, have MS Teams up and constantly visible to ensure no missed communications/meetings when actively using a personal device
- During work hours, have security cameras up and visible to ensure no missed packages while actively working on work computer
